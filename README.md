**Shell emulator and multitool for the video game Grey Hack.**

Now open source.
Very, very, very limited support available.
MIT license superscedes old 5hell license.

### To build in Grey Hack:


First make the directory /root/src as root (its important otherwise that action will get denied) inside your Game

**Tip: to escalate to root use this command:**

<pre>
sudo -s
</pre>

Copy the following .src files into the CodeEditor inside the Game:

***Make sure that the tickbox that says: "Importable" is ticked for each file!***

<pre>
 contrib.5pk.src      -->  contrib.5pk

 net.5pk.src          -->  net.5pk
 
 kore.5pk.src         -->  kore.5pk

 dtools.5pk.src       -->  dtools.5pk

 5phinx.5pk.src       -->  5phinx.5pk
</pre>

Each file goes to /root/src

-------------------------------------------------

**/root/src should now have the following built, importable files:**

<pre>
contrib.5pk

net.5pk

dtools.5pk

kore.5pk

5phinx.5pk
</pre>



## Final step for build

**Now, copy 5hell.5pk.src to code editor, mark as importable and build to /root/src/5hell.5pk**

<pre>
5hell.5pk imports all previous .5pk files and is imported by 5hell.src
</pre>

**Finally, copy 5hell.src to code editor**

select a password or passwords in the security section of 5hell.src



<pre>
access_codes = {"Alpha":"your_access_code_here", "Beta":"your_other_access_code_here"}
</pre>
**You can delete the "Beta" section if you want to use one password only.**


Then build to 5hell (or a filename of your choice)


***DO NOT MARK THE FINAL BUILD AS IMPORTABLE as this will compromise your password.***



***ALTERNATIVE! Delete the security section in 5hell.src and don't use a password (not recommended for Multiplayer)***

**YAY! Congrats, you just built 5hell. ;)**

---------------------------------------------------

### ADVANCED BUILD:

<pre>
For the example here make sure you point to the .src saved as textfile!
</pre>

You have the option of rebuilding 5hell using the makfit command.

<pre>
launch 5hell and read: makfit -h
</pre>

To use, run the following command in 5hell after building 5hell the first time as per above instructions.

<pre>
Next, run: makfit [path to 5hell.src] 120000
</pre>

(you can use any value above 100000 but 120k seems to have the most favorable time:size ratio)
This will build a new binary with a random file name and then rename the file back to 5hell.

File sizes are based on file name so makfit generates random names until the name produces a binary of the desired size.

Once 5hell is built you do not need the build files anymore unless you plan on rebuilding.

--------------------------------------------------------

### To start using 5hell:

You can use it right away out of the box but more benefits come from the following:

<pre>
|> indicates the prompt, don't type |> for the commands)
</pre>

### create your rootkit folder:

<pre>
|> mkdir /root/rkit
</pre>

populate the folder:

<pre>
|> kore -r
</pre>

-- this will copy /lib/crypto.so, /lib/metaxploit.so and 5hell to /root/rkit

5hell's exploit database is also written to:

<pre>
/root/rkit/database.csv
</pre>

The rootkit may also contain:

<pre>
/root/rkit/dig.bat
</pre>

-- this file is used by the dig command

-- commands written to this file are executed by 5hell after dig uploads and launches 5hell on a target.

-- write this file the same as a 'do' batch file, ie: write 5hell commands to be executed on each line (piping supported)

<pre>
|> pwgen | pwgen hash
</pre>

-- this will write a password table and a hash=password table to /root/tables/tp and /root/tables/t5 respectively

-- these tables are used by: cerebrum -i, brutus, herme5, and hashim for password cracking

-- in public this takes 20 minutes, in nightly it takes about 5

-- you only have to do it once then you can upload the table to other servers (or back it up somewhere)

You may also use:

<pre>
|> cerebrum
</pre>

-- to generate a password table at runtime (takes about a minute)



## Important Notes:


 Beginners should type

<pre>
|> help
</pre>
--For basic help info and a command list.
<pre>
|> help -s
</pre>
--To see info on all commands at once
<pre>
|> help -s [keyword]
</pre>
--To search all of the help info for that keyword (to find commands easier)
<pre>
|> help guide
</pre>
--To get a quick start guide

Beginners should also use 5phinx (sphinx) as this automates most hacking.

Results from 5phinx (or command line hacking) are sent to the BUFFER in memory alpha
type

<pre>
|> malp
</pre>

--to access memory alpha, then press 5 to access the buffer.

If you've built the rkit correctly, you can also simply type:

<pre>
|> dig [ip] [opt: port]
</pre>

and 5hell will do all the heavy lifting for you.

Type exit once dig is done to return to the 5hell session that launched the dig.

Alternatively, edit dig.bat and put
exit dig_complete
on the last line to autoexit and echo completion



# Additional Information and misc


**This section explains a few things about the 5hell in a more detailed manner.**
<pre>
This information is also shown inside the 5hell via the help -s command, 
but for better readability it is placed here as well as the very bottom.
</pre>


### The BUFFER

The BUFFER stores objects. Anything may be stored in the BUFFER.
<pre>
You access the BUFFER with the malp command >> option [5]
</pre>

When an exploit is run, the result is stored in the BUFFER. You
may interact with these objects in a number of ways by selecting them
from the list and using their context menu (if the object has one).
One way to fetch an object from the BUFFER for use elswhere is to use the clipboard:
<pre>
|> clipb @B [index]-- where index == BUFFER[index]
</pre>

-- then pipe the value to another function
<pre>
You may pipe anything into the buffer with |> [command_returning_input] | malp
</pre>

---

### Easy Clip!
 <pre>
You may reference the clipboards with the @ symbol:
clipa, clipb, and clipc are all clipboard spaces
</pre>
<pre>
You may use @a, @b, and @c to reference their values
e.g. echo hello world | clipa |  | poke hello.txt @a
*** tbuf, home, do ***
e.g. gopher @tbuf, e.g. rshell @home, e.g scribus @do
</pre>

---

### Custom Object

The Custom Object is a way for scripts to share information between
nested launches. This means you can launch 5hell with 5hell and pass objects back and forth.
You interact with the custom_object via the various cob commands
Namely: cob get and cob set.

For ease of use: cob get and cob set have been aliased to:
<pre>
-- get and set in 5hell.src
-- |> cob set bob burger is equivalent to |> set bob burger
-- |> cob get bob is quivalent to |> get bob
</pre>

An example would be cerebrum which loads the dictionary to the custom object:
<pre>
-- once loaded, you may run 5hell through nested launches and the dictionary will persist.
-- This also allows you to import/export metaLib's and metaxploitLib's between machines!
</pre>

---

## CONVENTIONS

**While a great deal of 5hell is discordant, there are some conventions:**

**You may toggle the full prompt and minimal prompt by typing:** 
<pre>
prompt 
</pre>
**at the command line**
 
### Input: 

arguments and quote blocks and piping oh my!

***5hell uses a 4 argument system. This means all commands take at most 4 arguments***

*this might sound limiting but it isn't at all in practice. Each of the 4 arguments may be overloaded.*

**Some input methods are:***

<pre>
simply typing input: |> ping 1.1.1.1
</pre>

up to four typed arguments

<pre>
remember that |> is the prompt, you don't type that part
</pre>

using single quotes to wrap text: 
<pre>
|> echo " this is a text block "  
</pre>
would return: **this is a text block**

note that: 
<pre>
|> echo "this is a text block" 
</pre>
would return: **""this is a text** 

this allows you to overload each argument with more than one "word"

easy clip and piping and objects(mostly) are preserved inside of text blocks

use do to run a batch of commands from a file or from memory using an editor

<pre>
|> do -- without arguments do will prompt for number of iterations then open the editor
</pre>
<pre>
|> do 1 -- would bring up an editor commands typed here will be executed in order
</pre>
<pre>
|> do 1 ping 1.1.1.1 -- would result in pinging 1.1.1.1 once
</pre>
<pre>
|> do 5 " rnip 1 | dig " -- would run dig on a random ip 5 times
</pre>
<pre>
|> do 1 -f /foo.bar -- execute the batch of commands in the file foo.bar
</pre>

you may launch 5hell from the game's command line with do parameters

the format is the same as if typing commands on the command line

newlines in the script are considered to be new command line entries

you may use piping, easy clip, and even calls for do to execute further scripts

you may use text blocks for complex commands in place of files or the editor if you wish

<pre>
|> do 3 " rnip 1 | dig |  | cob get metx | meta -i | db -m | zap " | poke test.txt " 
</pre>

this is a bunch of text going into a file 

it is possible to almost completely automate every aspect of 5hell via do and dig

for ease of use do 1 -f has been aliased to bat in 5hell.src:
<pre>
|> bat /foo.bar is equivalent to |> do 1 -f foo.bar
</pre>

**please see do -h and dig -h for more information on automation**

piping input: 
<pre>
|> grep -f ^syst | file -p | cp /etc/passwd
</pre>
would result in copying /etc/passwd over top of system.log (if permissions allowed it)

piping allows you to transfer the output of one command to the [last open parameter] of another command

in the above example the output of grep [args...] is the input of file -p [input]

and the output of file -p [args] is the input of cp /etc/passwd [input]

**please see pipe -h for more**

***if malp is the backbone of 5hell, pipes are the circulatory system of 5hell***

### Prompts: 

**|> , :> , ||:**

<pre>
|>  --  this is the standard Command Line Interface prompt
</pre>
by default there will be information printed before this

toggle to a minimalist prompt with: 
<pre>
prompt
</pre>

-- fires CLI commands

<pre>
|>   --  by default, the GLASSPOOL prompt turns the |> blue
</pre>

this means commands execute on the remote object controlled by glasspool

**see glaspool -h for more**

<pre>
:>   --  this is a liminal prompt, it expects a string or empty return
</pre>

this is used to gather user input within a command

<pre>
||:  --  this is an 'any key' prompt
</pre>
it takes a single keypress

this is used in 'button' driven menus

### Decision Pompts: [ N/Y/X ] [n/y/x]

-- Multiple choice prompts have a default

-- the default is always Capitolized and sometimes highlighted

-- the default is chosen if  is pressed without input

-- unless otherwise noted, default is chosen if input doesn't match a choice
<pre>
E.G: |> psudo
Open shell? [c/y/N]
||:
</pre>

in this example, the choices are [c], [y], and [N]
<pre>
[c] -- enter credentials

[y] -- open shell

[n] or anything else -- no; return/abort
</pre>
this is because **N** is the default

### Prompt: advanced

by default the prompt will display the public and local ip of the active shell

or computer if using glasspool on a computer object

by default the prompt will display computer name and working directory

by default the prompt indicates user privileges (root,user,guest) with:

under the ip information there will be a:

a red line for root, green line for user , and white line for guest

please note that user permissions are determined by access level and not by 'actual' user

you may customize the prompt to your liking in 5hell.src

---

### The dreaded System.log

***Actions that generate an entry in system.log:***

- establishing a net_session on a server (not a router)

- connecting via Browser.exe to a server

- connection established on port ##

- obtaining a shell (server/router)

- shell obtained on port ##

- deleting a file

- file deleted [ip]

- routing a connection with:

- connect_service or file_explorer

- connection routed [ip]

- shell disconnect

- i.e. exiting from start_terminal

- connection closed [ip]

---
Active Traces will start when shell.start_terminal is used
on an npc machine with an active admin of sufficient knowledge and give-a-damn.
Generally, if there is a root: dsession active, using start_terminal will trigger
an active trace. Active traces are stopped by disconnecting (exiting) that terminal instance.

When using 5hell you should NOT ever open a terminal (on a target) unless you are doing an Academic or
Police record mission. OR if you absolutely need to open the browser to edit firewall or port rules
on a target. Otherwise, use glasspool and run to leverage shell object manipulation instead.

However! You should start_terminal on your end point attack proxy. In fact, do it twice:

-- use prox to tunnel to your end point proxy then launch 5hell and type psudo and then select [y]

-- this will start_terminal on top of your start_terminal, effectively looping your connection on that machine

-- this will ensure your end point proxy's ip is left in logs. Without this, you risk exposing ip's behind the proxy.

***note: this means you'll have to 'exit' twice from that proxy to return home
Passive Traces can/will start when certain actions have been left unaddressed:***

- ***Deleting a file and not removing the log entry***
- ***Leaving a connection closed log without a corresponding connection established log***
- ***Leaving a shell connected log at all***
- ***I think connection routed logs trigger traces, too. Not sure though.***

We all leave logs, sometimes. To clean them up, here are a few methods:
<pre>
Silentclean -- local log corruption using a text file
</pre>
creates a file used to corrupt logs

**has nuke option (see: silentclean -h)**

<pre>
Rclean -- remote (or local) log corruption using objects
</pre>
uses a file already on system to corrupt logs

accepts and works on piped objects see: 
<pre>
rclean -h
</pre>

### MV 

yep, just the mv command

<pre>
poke haha | mv haha /var/system.log
</pre>

Wiping the log with one of these methods using a reverse shell is best
but not necessary. 

You may run: 
<pre>
silentclean, exit 5hell, exit the terminal, and you will not leave a disconnect log.
</pre>
***be aware that taking any log-creating action after running sc, except exiting, may regenerate the log.***

## Aliases

**Aliases || Shortcuts || Macros || or is it Macro's ? || User Defined Behavior**

5hell can be very simple to use, or very, very complicated, depending on your goals.
It isn't necessary to learn 100% of 5hell. Nor is it necessary to suffer through some of it's
more complex chains of commands. You can define your own behavior in a number of ways:

Aliases: 
 You may define aliases in the aliases section of 5hell.src
the default ones supplied are all prompt replacements. There are also 'easy clip' defenitions
that replace arguments in the user input with, for instance, the contents of a clipboard or
your @home server ip. These hard coded aliases may be more complicated than a simple
word or string replacement. You may, for instance, have a simple two word alias fire
a whole series of commands. This might be considered a macro at that point, but also
might not quite qualify.

Here is a list of the currently defined default aliases in 5hell.src:

<pre>
Alias           | Definition
bat [path]      | do 1 -f [path]
set [key] [val] | cob set [key] [val]
get [key]       | cob get [key]
lock            | perms lock all
exit            | quit
sc [opt]        | silentclean [opt]
gp [#]          | glasspool [#]
prompt          | -this will toggle the full_prompt on/off-

Easy Clip       | Replacement
@a              | clipa -- globals.clip_board_alpha
@b              | clipb -- globals.clip_board_beta
@c              | clipc -- globals.clip_board_gamma
@tbuf           | transmission buffer -- globals.T_BUF
-- this is      | where hashes go when the tree command finds them
@home           | HOME_SERVER ip address defined in 5hell.src
</pre>

***Please note: several commands have their own references for editing the clipboards***

-- these commands will use @clipa, @clipb, @clipc instead of @a, @b, @c
Further, the clipa, clipb, and clipc will use @B to reference the BUFFER:

-- e.g: 
<pre>
|> clipa @B 1 -- copy the object at index 1 in the BUFFER to clipa
</pre>
-- that object may then be used by other commands that accept piped objects as input

-- there are other ways to pipe objects around besides the clipboards, explore to learn more.

# Documentation
<pre>
This is the same documentation the command 'help -s' would show inside 5hell
</pre>

### air

<pre>
air: aircrack menu. Saves cracked .cap files to current path and reads those files from current path. 
Advanced: air [-f|false] -- same as command.iwlist, prints wifi nets in range and exits.
Advanced: air -c [/path_to_file.cap] -- uses aircrack to return passkey from file.cap
Advanced: select option [h] within air to activate detection of hidden wifi signals.
-- You must be within range (on the same network) to detect and connect to these non-broadcasting signals.
-- This allows bypassing firewalls in many instances.
</pre>

---

### append
<pre>
Usage: append [path_to_file] [text] (works best with pipe) --  add text to end of file.
Usage: append [file_object] [text] -- append text to file object
-- pipe file object to clipa/b/c and use @a/b/c to reference
-- eg: clipb @B 1 -- where BUFFER[1] is a file, then: append @b [text]
Usage: append @clipa|b|c [text] -- append to the end of a clip space.
N.B. @clipa and @clipc will append text directly with no new line. 
 -- @clipb will add a new line and then append text.
</pre>

---

-- when used on a remote 'silent launch' of 5hell
---- pipes aptclientLib to the custom object then exits back to original 5hell
-- cob get apt | aptm
---- pipes aptclientLib to aptm and changes scope of aptm to remote
Advanced: press [7] hot_swap_libs in aptm 
-- reloads meta/crypto/apt to use latest versions after updating
</pre>

Usage: bios -i [path] -- runs include_lib on path and returns result
-- init.so, net.so, kernel_module.so cannot be imported as they lack an API
-- prompts for path if path not supplied
---- e.g.|> bios -i /lib/blockchain.so | malp 
---- returns the blockchainLib object and pipes it to malp (to the BUFFER)
---- note: cannot include_lib net.so, init.so, kernel_module.so
------ only libs with API's may use include_lib
------ use meta link to load those with the metaxploitLib
</pre>

---

### brutus
<pre>
Brutus: dictionary attack psudo brute force type tool
Usage: brutus -- attempt to gain root pass and shell using onboard dict_a 
(Default onboard dict_a: [1] passwords)

Usage: brutus -i [/path|object] -- import dictionary (may be csv or newline separated values)
-- 5hell will attempt to determine the type. Please ensure valid inputs.
-- accepts: path to file or folder, or piped file/folder object
-- See dfit for making a.csv from newline separated dictionary file.
-- See cerebrum for altering onboard dict_a
Advanced: brutus -s [shell_object] [ip] -- use shell_object to initiate ssh + brutus attack against ip 
(equal to command.ssh root@-brutus [ip] but uses the given shell instead of active shell)
cad
cad: cloak and dagger protocol.

### cob
<pre>
Cobble || custom object || cob || meta buffer
Usage: cob set [key] [val] -- set custom object key to val.
-- returns string on success or error
Usage: cob get [key] -- get value of custom object key.
-- returns value at key or null
-- returns @reference (pointer) if value is a function
Usage: cob return -- returns the raw custom object
-- pipe to command.code to decompile the object.
-- ie: cob return | code
Usage: cob inspect -- returns key/value pair information of custom object
-- returns a string pairing each key with its [trucated] value
-- values are truncated to make the object easier to inspect
-- please use cob return | code if you want the raw output
Usage: cob indexes -- return custom object indexes as a LIST
-- pipe to the string command to stringify
Usage: cob search [val] --  search for index of val.
-- returns string; key or failure message.
Inactive: cob sign -- future ability to sign custom object.
-- currently returns 0 (zero).
Usage: cob del [key] -- delete key and its value from custom object.
-- returns string on success or failure.
Usage: cob purge -- purge the custom object
Usage: cob install [key] -- install a function residing in the custom object at [key]
-- this will add the function as a 5hell command (it will show up in help)
-- functions must still follow the standard template to avoid errors
-- the funciton will not persist after 5hell is closed
-- please compile your custom function into 5hell.src for persistent functions
Advanced: the cerebrum command loads the dictionary to the custom object
-- it is loaded to custom_object.dictionary and can be removed by passing the 'purge' param to cerebrum
-- this is allows you to use the dictionary between nested shell.launches with only a single run of cerebrum.

N.B. -- since version 3.8.3 5hell.src contains aliases for cob set and cob get:
Usage: set [key] [value] -- same as cob set [key] [value]
Usage: get [key] -- same as cob get [key]

### db
<pre>
DB || dbaser || Databaser
Automated remote port and local lib scanning and databasing.
Results are sent to the BUFFER.
Database is saved to ~/rkit/database.csv
Logs: logs will be left by db when:
-- a net_session is obtained on a server (not a router):
-- connection established port ##
-- a shell object is obtained on any machine:
-- shell obtained on port ##
Note: logs may be left in other ways. See: help logs for more.

Note: targetIP and targetPort are set with probe and/or target

Usage: db [-r] [opt:ip] [opt:port] [bool:inject]
-- scans given port and databases results
-- uses targetIP and targetPort if not supplied
-- supplying [1] for inject boolean results in a prompt
---- enter a lan_ip or password for the inject value at the prompt
Usage: db -r [ip] * -- db all ports at given ip
Usage: db -r * -- db all ports of targetIP

Usage: db [-l] [opt:lib_name] [bool:inject]
-- scan a local lib and database resutls
-- brings up menu if lib_name not supplied
-- supplying [1] for inject boolean results in a prompt
---- enter a lan_ip or password for the inject value at the prompt
Usage: db -l * -- db all local libs

Usage: db [-m] -- scan currently linked metaLib
-- unlike other modes, this mode will not link a new metaLib
-- instead, it scans the already linked metaLib
---- use meta link [piped_metaLib] to choose a metaLib to scan
---- use meta -i [pipe_metaxploitLib] to choose the scanning metaxploitLib
---- see meta help for more

Note: Use meta link and meta scan to scan without databasing
Note: It is not possible exploit/database libs that are not in the /lib folder
</pre>

---

### dfit
<pre>
Usage: dfit [path_to_file]

</pre>

---

### diff
<pre>
DIFF || DIFFERENCES || FILE COMPARE || TEXT COMPARE
Usage: diff [input_1] [input_2] -- standard diff tool
Usage: diff [file_1_path|file_1_object|text_block_1] [file_2_path|file_2_object|text_block_2]
-- compares text of input_1 to input_2 and prints output
-- prints differences when encountered
-- input_1 text is prepended with the - character
-- input_2 text is prepended with the + character

Input notes:
:: if input_1 or input_2 are single words they are processed as paths to a file
:: if input_2 or input_2 are more than one word (ie piped text) they are processed as strings
:: does not process binary files or lists
:: -- for lists pipe the output of string [yourlist]
</pre>

---

### dig
<pre>
DIG v 2.1 Netcrawler || Autohacking || Automation
Usage: dig [-s|ip|port] [port|ip] [opt:--edit] -- auto-infiltrate a target
-- runs db on target [ip] and [port]
-- infiltrates via shell if found
-- uploads rkit and runs 5hell on the target
-- gains root and wipes the log
-- performs other taskes as defined by the user in dig.bat
-- dig.bat may contain docalls (do # -f your.file) to daisy chain digs
Note: dig may take port and ip in any order
-- not supplying a port defaults to port 0 aka the rouer
Usage: dig -s -- will scan the internet for a suitable target
-- uses database.csv to choose targets with known kernel_router versions
-- if the matched router has a shell exploit, dig will auto infiltrate as normal
-- susses out random ips until a match is found
-- sussing routers does not leave a log if no shell is found
Note: edit /root/rkit/dig.bat to customize behavior
-- by default you will be prompted to exit 5hell when dig completes
-- type 'y' to exit and return to the script that launched dig
-- or add quit dig_complete to exit automatically with an echo
Note: supplying --edit as argument three will open dig.bat in scribus
-- dig will continue as normal after editing is complete
-- you may add/remove commands to be executed by dig here
Note: supplying --edit as agrgument one will open dig.bat in scribus
-- dig will then exit after editing the batch file.
Usage example:|> rnip 1 | dig 
Usage example:|> dig 1.1.1.1 22 --edit
Usage example:|> do 20 | dig -s
</pre>

---

### do
<pre>
DO || SCRIPTING || AUTOMATION || NOT BASH || BATCH COMMANDS
The scheduling or automation service for 5hell. You write a set of
commands for 5hell to do. Commands may be entered in-line on the
command line, entered into a text editor buffer, or read from a text file.
see also: do help extra -- for some example do scripts
-- see also: help prompt, dig -h, scribus -h
Do may be launched in a number of ways, depending on your goals:

Usage: do [int] [command] [arg1] [arg2]-- perform [command] [int] times
-- passes arg1 and arg2 to the command
-- use text blocks to pass complex arguments and/or complex commands
-- eg: |> do 3 " rnip 1 | probe | db -r | zap " 
-- eg: |> do 1 poke test.txt " this is a bunch of text " 
---- note: in practice the above line can be done without the do 1
---- it's just an example of how you would supply complex parameters to do
- - - - - - - - - - - 
Usage: do -- without arguments will prompt for iterations then open the editor
Usage: do [#] -- supplying iteration without a command opens the editor immediately
-- enter commands into the editor and enter @ on a newline to begin execution
-- the commands in the editor remain until changed and therefore may be rerun/reused
-- you may use scribus @do to edit the do buffer without firing the script

Usage: do [int] -f [/path] -- perform commands in [/path] [int] times
-- the preferred method of firing a 'batch' of commands
-- many examples may use a .bat extension but the .bat extension is not enforced at all
-- it is just a convention, you may name them whatever you wish except:
---- dig.bat must be named dig.bat in order for dig to use it (see dig -h)
-- nested calls to the do command within these files are valid and encouraged
---- dig.bat: cerebrum | brutus | run /home/guest/rkit/5hell " do 1 -f file2.bat | exit done " 
---- file2.bat: rshell @home | sc -d | exit rshell_placed
-- by placing these two files in your rkit folder and running dig [ip] you are able to:
---- automate: infiltrating and placing a root rshell on the target
----- removing your rkit
----- and cleaning the log
Alias: do 1 -f [path] has been aliased to bat [path] in 5hell.src

You may launch 5hell from the game's command line with a 'do' instruction:
-- instead of launching 5hell simply by typing '5hell' you may launch with:
----# 5hell do [#] [opt:-f] [command|path]
-- and 5hell will launch and immediately begin running the given commands
-- 5hell will then drop to the exit prompt;
---- press 'y' if you wish to exit, press enter or any other key to continue running
This allows 5hell to launch 5hell with instructions to launch 5hell with instructions to...
-- keep in mind there is a game limit of 15 nested uses of shell.launch
-- but no limit to the number of uses of shell.launch; meaning do 1000 dig -s is completely valid
</pre>

---

### echo
<pre>
ECHO || echo || Echo || echO
Usage: echo [up] [to] [four] [params] -- returns concatonated params to the terminal

General usage is to echo text back to the terminal during batch script/macro execution.
However, it may also be used to feed input to another command or concatonate outputs
of multiple commands. You may use floating quotes (single quotes not touching another
character) to wrap complex input parameters. Examples:
|> echo bob burger  --  output: bob burger
|> echo " Eat at Joe's Diner. " Because " it's the best. " 
-- output: Eat at Joe's diner. Because it's the best.
|> echo three four | echo one two -- output: one two three four
Here's a fairly useless example, lol:
|> cat file.txt | echo | poke file2.txt | cat | echo | poke file3.txt
</pre>

### enum
<pre>
enumeration || ENUM || enum buffer
Use this to put things in a list.

-- searches for text matching a given pattern
-- returns all matching text, with line numbers and positions, found in search_path
-- search_path may be a file, or folder, or object
-- descends folders and files from search_path
-- descends from / on object if search_path is a shell or computer object
-- descends from path of file if search_path is a file object

Usage: grep [-f] [pattern] [search_path|object] -- grep for file
-- searches search_path or piped object for a file with name matching pattern 
-- piped computer and shell objects will be searched from the / directory.
-- piped file objects will be searched from the path of the file.
-- returns a file object for the first match in the file tree
---- what coutns as a first match is still a w.i.p....

Usage: grep [-n|-fn] [pattern] [search_path|object] -- grep for file name
-- searches search_path for file with name matching pattern
-- returns the file name as a string
-- uses the same search method as -f
-- the -fn option is equivalent to the -n option

Usage: grep [-p|-fp] [pattern] [search_path|object] -- grep for file path
-- searches search_path for file with name matching pattern
-- returns the file path as a string
-- uses same search method as -f
-- -fp option is equivalent to -p option

current regex tokens (more planned):
c   matches any literal character 'c'
-- bob matches bob anywhere in the text.
^   match pattern from beginning of word
-- ^ber matches bertha  does not match robert
$   match end of line (goes at end of pattern)
-- .txt$ matches file.txt does not match file.txt.src
#   matches one or more of preceding character
-- c# matches c, cc, ccc, cccc 
*   matches any unicode char (wildcard)
-- *#:*#  matches root:password, email@domain.com:password, xyz:1234
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Important! Runtime depends on length of pattern and size of text to check. 
Since grep will recurse any folders in a given path, this command could result in very long run times. 
It is up to you to limit the scope of your searches accordingly.

-- build files with different names until at or below the desired size.
-- if the -n option is used, no input file is used
---- instead a dummy file is used and saved as the discovered name

Usage: makfit [/path.src] [target_size_in_bytes] [opt: -A --include uppercase]
-- target size in bytes determines ceiling for acceptable file size
---- min 120000, max unlimited however it is unlikely to see > 10MB
-- will change the file's name back to the name of the .src when done
-- builds to size and outputs to parent path of .src file.
Extra: makfit [-n] [target_size_in_bytes] [opt:-A] -- do not use a source file 
-- final filename may be used when compiling any script
-- this allows you to find a filename without supplying a source file.
Note: when successful makfit will return the compressed file as an object.
Usage Example:
|> poke my.src | scribus | makfit my.src 150000 | run

</pre>

---

### meta
<pre>
Metaxploit || MetaxploitLib || exploits || XPLOITS || MetaLib || Hack
Important note: 
A metaxploitLib is the object obtained from include_lib(metaxploit.so)
A metaLib is the object obtained from metaxploit.load() or net_session.dump_lib
A net_session object will dump a metaLib object
A metaLib gets scanned, a metaxploitLib does the scanning.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  - - - - - - - - - - 
The meta command is used for fine control over metaLib and metaxploitLib processes
Usage: meta -- print the currently linked metaLib name and version if any.
Usage: meta link -- links a remote netsession using targetIP and TargetPort
Usage: meta link [opt] [opt]-- links a remote or local metaLib
-- this is equivalent to the 5phinx [+] or [=] buttons
Usage: meta link [metaLib] -- directly link a piped metaLib object
Usage: meta link -l [opt:lib_name] -- link a local metaLib
-- passing a lib name will link that lib if it is in /lib
-- not passing a lib name will bring up the menu
----- the menu will display libs in the localhost's /lib folder
----- if using an imported metaxploitLib  the list will be wrong
----- selecting a lib from the list that is present on the target will still work
----- the metaxploitLib  object looks at the lib folder of it's native machine
----- use the ls command to get the correct contents of /lib 
----- or run the db -m command with a glasspool shell/computer on the target
Usage: meta link -r -- link a remote net_session using targetIP and targetPort
-- skips confirmation
Usage: meta scan -- scans the linked metaLib and loads vulns to memory
-- does NOT update the database
-- equivalent to 5phinx [1]
-- use db -r or db -l or db -m for databasing
-- use zap or roil or 5phinx [A] or [2] after scanning to fire the exploits
Usage: meta -i [path|metaxploitLib] -- import a new metaxploitLib 
-- imports from a path or from a piped object
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Next: once a metaLib or net_session is linked:
-- scan the imported object with meta scan or db -m
-- if not using db use roil to send all attacks at once (does not database results)
-- use db -m to force databasing the linked metaLib 
-- n.b: running db without -m will cause db to look for a new lib to link and overwrite the linked metaLib)

Note: importing a metaxploitLib from your server to a remote target allows using your hardware to scan the targets local libs.
--Likewise, exporting a remote metaLib back to your server allows you to use your hardware to scan the remote libs.
-- use bios> along with cob get and cob set to import/export objects

## Additional Information and misc

<pre>
The BUFFER
The BUFFER stores objects. Anything may be stored in the BUFFER.
You access the BUFFER with the malp command >> option [5]
When an exploit is run, the result is stored in the BUFFER. You
may interact with these objects in a number of ways by selecting them
from the list and using their context menu (if the object has one).
One way to fetch an object from the BUFFER for use elswhere is to use the clipboard:
|> clipb @B [index]-- where index == BUFFER[index]
-- then pipe the value to another function
You may pipe anything into the buffer with |> [command_returning_input] | malp

Easy Clip! You may reference the clipboards with the @ symbol:
***  clipa, clipb, and clipc are all clipboard spaces  ***
You may use @a, @b, and @c to reference their values
e.g. echo hello world | clipa |  | poke hello.txt @a
*** tbuf, home, do ***
e.g. gopher @tbuf, e.g. rshell @home, e.g scribus @do

The CUSTOM_OBJECT is a way for scripts to share information between
nested launches. This means you can launch 5hell with 5hell and pass objects back and forth.
You interact with the custom_object via the various cob commands
Namely: cob get and cob set.
For ease of use: cob get and cob set have been aliased to:
-- get and set in 5hell.src
-- |> cob set bob burger is equivalent to |> set bob burger
-- |> cob get bob is quivalent to |> get bob
An example would be cerebrum which loads the dictionary to the custom object:
-- once loaded, you may run 5hell through nested launches and the dictionary will persist.
-- This also allows you to import/export metaLib's and metaxploitLib's between machines!

CONVENTIONS
While a great deal of 5hell is discordant, there are some conventions:

You may toggle the full prompt and minimal promt by typing: 
prompt at the command line
- - - - - - - - - - 
Input: arguments and quote blocks and piping oh my!
-- 5hell uses a 4 argument system. This means all commands take at most 4 arguments
-- this might sound limiting but it isn't at all in practice. Each of the 4 arguments may be overloaded.
Some input methods are:
----* simply typing input: |> ping 1.1.1.1
------ up to four typed arguments
------ remember that |> is the prompt, you don't type that part
----* using single quotes to wrap text: |> echo " this is a text block " 
------ would return: this is a text block
------ note that: |> echo "this is a text block" 
------ would return: ""this is a text 
------ this allows you to overload each argument with more than one "word"
------ easy clip and piping and objects(mostly) are preserved inside of text blocks
----* use do to run a batch of commands from a file or from memory using an editor
------ |> do -- without arguments do will prompt for number of iterations then open the editor
------ |> do 1 -- would bring up an editor commands typed here will be executed in order
------ |> do 1 ping 1.1.1.1 -- would result in pinging 1.1.1.1 once
------ |> do 5 " rnip 1 | dig " -- would run dig on a random ip 5 times
------ |> do 1 -f /foo.bar -- execute the batch of commands in the file foo.bar
-------- you may launch 5hell from the game's command line with do parameters
-------- the format is the same as if typing commands on the command line
-------- newlines in the script are considered to be new command line entries
-------- you may use piping, easy clip, and even calls for do to execute further scripts
-------- you may use text blocks for complex commands in place of files or the editor if you wish
---------- |> do 3 " rnip 1 | dig |  | cob get metx | meta -i | db -m | zap " | poke test.txt " this is a bunch of text going into a file "
****** it is possible to almost completely automate every aspect of 5hell via do and dig
------ for ease of use do 1 -f has been aliased to bat in 5hell.src:
-------- |> bat /foo.bar is equivalent to |> do 1 -f foo.bar
------ please see do -h and dig -h for more information on automation
----* piping input: |> grep -f ^syst | file -p | cp /etc/passwd
------ would result in copying /etc/passwd over top of system.log (if permissions allowed it)
------ piping allows you to transfer the output of one command to the [last open parameter] of another command
------ in the above example the output of grep [args...] is the input of file -p [input]
------ and the output of file -p [args] is the input of cp /etc/passwd [input]
------ please see pipe -h for more
------ if malp is the backbone of 5hell, pipes are the circulatory system of 5hell

Prompts: |> , :> , ||: 
|>  --  this is the standard Command Line Interface prompt
-- by default there will be information printed before this
-- toggle to a minimalist prompt with: prompt
-- fires CLI commands
|>   --  by default, the GLASSPOOL prompt turns the |> blue
-- this means commands execute on the remote object controlled by glasspool
-- see glaspool -h for more
:>   --  this is a liminal prompt, it expects a string or empty return
-- this is used to gather user input within a command
||:  --  this is an 'any key' prompt
-- it takes a single keypress
-- this is used in 'button' driven menus

Decision Pompts: [ N/Y/X ] [n/y/x]
-- Multiple choice prompts have a default
-- the default is always Capitolized and sometimes highlighted
-- the default is chosen if  is pressed without input
-- unless otherwise noted, default is chosen if input doesn't match a choice
E.G: |> psudo
Open shell? [c/y/N]
||:
-- in this example, the choices are [c], [y], and [N]
---- [c] -- enter credentials
---- [y] -- open shell
---- [n] or anything else -- no; return/abort
------ this is because N is the default

Prompt: advanced:
-- by default the prompt will display the public and local ip of the active shell
---- or computer if using glasspool on a computer object
-- by default the prompt will display computer name and working directory
-- by default the prompt indicates user privileges (root,user,guest) with:
---- under the ip information there will be a:
------ a red line for root, green line for user , and white line for guest
---- please note that user permissions are determined by access level and not by 'actual' user
-- you may customize the prompt to your liking in 5hell.src

The dreaded System.log
Actions that generate an entry in system.log: 
-- establishing a net_session on a server (not a router)
-- connecting via Browser.exe to a server
---- connection established on port ##
-- obtaining a shell (server/router)
---- shell obtained on port ##
-- deleting a file
---- file deleted [ip]
-- routing a connection with:
-- connect_service or file_explorer
---- connection routed [ip]
-- shell disconnect
-- i.e. exiting from start_terminal
---- connection closed [ip]

Active Traces will start when shell.start_terminal is used
on an npc machine with an active admin of sufficient knowledge and give-a-damn.
Generally, if there is a root: dsession active, using start_terminal will trigger
an active trace. Active traces are stopped by disconnecting (exiting) that terminal instance.

When using 5hell you should NOT ever open a terminal (on a target) unless you are doing an Academic or
Police record mission. OR if you absolutely need to open the browser to edit firewall or port rules
on a target. Otherwise, use glasspool and run to leverage shell object manipulation instead.

However! You should start_terminal on your end point attack proxy. In fact, do it twice:
-- use prox to tunnel to your end point proxy then launch 5hell and type psudo and then select [y]
-- this will start_terminal on top of your start_terminal, effectively looping your connection on that machine
-- this will ensure your end point proxy's ip is left in logs. Without this, you risk exposing ip's behind the proxy.
-- note: this means you'll have to 'exit' twice from that proxy to return home
Passive Traces can/will start when certain actions have been left unaddressed:
- Deleting a file and not removing the log entry
- Leaving a connection closed log without a corresponding connection established log
- Leaving a shell connected log at all
- I think connection routed logs trigger traces, too. Not sure though.

We all leave logs, sometimes. To clean them up, here are a few methods:
Silentclean -- local log corruption using a text file
-- creates a file used to corrupt logs
-- has nuke option (see: silentclean -h)
Rclean -- remote (or local) log corruption using objects
-- uses a file already on system to corrupt logs
-- accepts and works on piped objects (see: rclean -h)
MV 
-- yep, just the mv command
-- poke haha | mv haha /var/system.log
Wiping the log with one of these methods using a reverse shell is best
but not necessary. You may run silentclean, exit 5hell, exit the terminal, and you will not leave a disconnect log.
-- be aware that taking any log-creating action after running sc, except exiting, may regenerate the log.

Main tools:
probe -- whois and portmap a target
db -- scan target and database results
meta -- metaLib and metaxploitLib fine control
zap -- select and fire exploits one at a time (does not database)
roil -- fire all exploits at once (does not database)
malp -- Memory Alpha: BUFFER management
-- exploit results and other objects go here
-- this is arguably the backbone of 5hell
scpm -- menu and/or cli driven scp
kraken -- proxy management
scribus -- simple text editor
cerebrum -- add 325k+ passwords to custom_object.dictionary
brutus -- use custom_object.dictionary to get root on any (unmodified) npc machine

Aliases || Shortcuts || Macros || or is it Macro's ? || User Defined Behavior
5hell can be very simple to use, or very, very complicated, depending on your goals.
It isn't necessary to learn 100% of 5hell. Nor is it necessary to suffer through some of it's
more complex chains of commands. You can define your own behavior in a number of ways:

Aliases: 
 You may define aliases in the aliases section of 5hell.src
the default ones supplied are all prompt replacements. There are also 'easy clip' defenitions
that replace arguments in the user input with, for instance, the contents of a clipboard or
your @home server ip. These hard coded aliases may be more complicated than a simple
word or string replacement. You may, for instance, have a simple two word alias fire
a whole series of commands. This might be considered a macro at that point, but also
might not quite qualify.

Here is a list of the currently defined default aliases in 5hell.src:
Alias           | Definition
bat [path]      | do 1 -f [path]
set [key] [val] | cob set [key] [val]
get [key]       | cob get [key]
lock            | perms lock all
exit            | quit
sc [opt]        | silentclean [opt]
gp [#]          | glasspool [#]
prompt          | -this will toggle the full_prompt on/off-

Easy Clip       | Replacement
@a              | clipa -- globals.clip_board_alpha
@b              | clipb -- globals.clip_board_beta
@c              | clipc -- globals.clip_board_gamma
@tbuf           | transmission buffer -- globals.T_BUF
-- this is                | where hashes go when the tree command finds them
@home           | HOME_SERVER ip address defined in 5hell.src

Please note: several commands have their own references for editing the clipboards
-- these commands will use @clipa, @clipb, @clipc instead of @a, @b, @c
Further, the clipa, clipb, and clipc will use @B to reference the BUFFER:
-- e.g: |> clipa @B 1 -- copy the object at index 1 in the BUFFER to clipa
-- that object may then be used by other commands that accept piped objects as input
-- there are other ways to pipe objects around besides the clipboards, explore to learn more.
