//
// changes:
//
// to do:
// convince author of Medusa to port it to 5hell // can just wrap medusa into a command. it just works.
// mail: add command line brutus login
// database overhaul :(
// tdump: wait for response feature
// add chmod/perms to command.felix
// add custom theme config
// add a way to tell grep to ignore specific folders
// expand tree -f to take both path and object as params (jk have to start over) 
// -- kinda fixed this in the regular tree command...
// update 5phinx F1 help info: remove or correct outdated info
// scp falsely reports failure sometimes: track this down
// absolutely must update the databasing system
// -- a single flat file is not sufficient
// update chop and grep to use piped strings
//
// todo: kraken
// todo: db
// todo: tree -f has a superior search algo vs regular, ancient tree
// -- lets bring tree into the [-f]uture
// todo: consolidate reused code in purge
// do: doesn't play nice with ||
//
//
// cob: added ability to 'cob inspect' a map within the custom object (currently only one layer deep)
// --eg: cob set mac {} || cob set mac.lmore " tags " || cob inspect mac 
// macro: fixed issue causing the wrong part of the string to be highlited when a selfcall is possible
// sphinx: you may now launch 5phinx without metaxploit or crypto present
// -- scanning won't work, but you can still launch it and use probe, idk
// -- just feels weird blocking it
// contrib.5pk: rejuggled the position of two functions because i forgot why i had put them in their pre-juggle position in the first place
// probe: when probing a lan ip that is not a router, probe will walk that subnet 1 ip at a time to find the correct router
// sphinx: the port info display (under target ip display) in sphinx will update this information when port is a router an the probe is actually done
// -- it won't, in most cases, update when only theip itself is changed. have to redo the probe first
// -- changing the port number *should* update the port info right away
// -- changing target ip to a public ip *will* immediately update the port info to the new router if target port is also a router
//
// the whole thing: threw @'s at 5hell to prevent unwanted rogue function execution when passing functions around as params for *some* commands
// -- if you find cases where I missed and you think it needs it, pleae @ me. If you don't like how messy the code is, don't @ me, bro.
// -- the goal is to allow functions to be passed around as if they were objects and only execute them when we really, really want to
// -- you can run params through globals.Kérberos( arg ) as an @ reference (ie: arg = Kérberos(@arg)
// NEW FUNCTION: Kérberos(arg) will return arg as a reference if it is not a function and will return:
// ---- Kérberos: prevented rogue function execution
// -- if arg is a function
// -- put this in your custom commands (or existing commands) if piped functions are executing without your permission
// run: will not execute piped function refrences
// run: updated usage info
// echo: will not execute piped function refrences
// ez_clip: will (hopefully) not execute function references
// malp: rogue function prevention added
// 5hell.src: added --daemons, --daemons stop [name] to view and stop daemons
// 5hell.src: added rogue function execution prevention
// clip[a|b|c]: _complete__rewrite_
// -- consolidated code
// -- clipboard is now a map; easier to add new clip spaces if desired
// -- easier to incorporate into future session objects
// -- added --, ++, -=, += for incrementing/decrementing the clipboard if it is an int or string: int
// -- added -z -- set clipboard to zero
// -- added -n -- set clipboard to null
// -- updated usage info
// -- usage info is larger than the actual clipboard code :|
// globals: changed all references to old globals.clip_board_x to globals.CLIP[index]
// -- in the future this will be session.CLIP[index]
// 5hell.src: updated comment regarding do.rc to include putting a priority version in Config 
// -- the one in Config supercedes the one in rkit 
// -- this info is in the help info but i felt it also belonged in 5hell.src
// malp: option [3] upload rkit will now launch 5hell right away without prompts
// -- use [8] run if you want to run it with launch params
// -- this routine now uses command.infil, which is a new command
// malp: will no longer execute piped/stored functions without being told to do so
// new: command.infil: runs the same routing as [3] in malp
// -- because why wasn't this a command?
// --: infil [shell_object] [opt:params]
// --eg: infil @B -m " bat pwn.bat "
// globals.decompiler: overhauled decompiler, p_validate, p_exe
// -- these will play nicer with piped functions 
// -- at the moment, to explicitly execute a piped function; pipe it to command.code 
// --eg: cob get funky_town | code
// -- this prompts for each param the function takes, if any, before executing the function and returning the result
// ---- i hope to improve on this in the future
// _switch: overhauled to better handle piped functions
// cob: you may now get and set nested indexes within maps s
// -- setting list indexes still needs work; needs push, pull, pop, etc
// ---- so that will be Soon(tm)
// -- see cob -h for details
// rclean: cleaned up 'detection_factor' display
// -- fixed crash when selecting an object from the mini-menu when using @B -m
// help: added missing -A flag option
// dig: fixed the 'idfk' database error (fucking hopefully, idfk)
// linkdb: will now return 1 on success and 0 on fail 
// calc: moved from kore.5pk to dtools.5pk to free up space and also because it kinda belongs there anyway
// code: moved to dtools.5pk from 5hell.5pk
// pwgen: moved to contrib.5pk from dtools.5pk
// 
//
// 5hell.5pk: added colorGrey
// 5phinx.5pk: removed over 10k chars of legacy/commented code
// dtools.5pk: also removed a bunch of legacy code
// 5phinx: imporoved target port information display
// -- it won't mix and match your targets anymore 
// -- Except: when target port is 0 and target ip is not a router
// ---- then port info will show the gateway router of the network
// ---- i may or may not 'fix' this. atm, i can't decide if it's good or bad.
// probe: upgraded super powers:
// -- will now show machines not directly connected to a _remote_ router in grey
// ---- when probing a local network, this won't apply
// -- when probing a remote network, this applies to machines with a port forwarded to them that are not on the gateway's subnet
// NOTE: when combined with the below, a machine with lib and ip in grey is most likely non-existant!
// -- will now (attempt to) distinguish between non-existant machines vs non-responsive machines (aka missing lib)
// -- formerly ports forwarded to non-existant machiens showed as "unknown"
// ---- they will now show as "no machine" in grey
// -- formerly ports forwarded to non-responsive machines showed as "unknown"
// ---- they will now show as "no response" in grey
// ---- machines with an active port but missing/corrupt .so will show as "no response"
// --NOTE: when a portscan is run externally and a port is forwarded to an existing machine within the network that is; 
// ---- (a) not directly connected to the gateway
// ---- (b) missing it's lib.so
// -- the machine will show as "no machine" instead of "no response" despite the machine existing
// ---- when probe is run internally on the same network, that same machine will show, correctly, as "no response"
// ---- this will change when i think up an efficient solution. the current state is a bit hacky
// NOTE: to reiterate: if port/lib info AND lan ip are greyed out, the machine is either not there at all, or is nuked
// -- it's difficult to tell for sure without investigating it yourself. gl.
// probe: fixed typo causing crash in update_port_info
// probe: fixed typo causing crash in usage info; updated usage info
// purge: added -p -- purge PORT_MAP
// kore: fixed crash on no arguments
//
// 5hell.5pk: moved globals.get_file to 5phinx.5pk bc 5hell.5pk ran out of room
// globals.get_file: will now return a file object if passed a file object
// -- formerly the function would return the file path if input was a file object, and file object if input was a file path
// -- now get_file will always return a file object
// -- this will probably break some things...
// 5hell.src: moved checking if prompt[0] is a file that we are trying to run to after confirming it isn't a command
// -- this will reduce get_file calls (which recurse the whole filesystem) 
// ---- as well as preventing files with the same name as a command from interfering with command execution
// probe: facelift; color coded aspects of the output
// -- red: switch or firewall or closed port
// -- green: open port (includes gateway and internal)
// -- magenta: non-switch router/machine with port 8080
// -- cyan: known lib
// -- gold: unknown lib
// -- orange: no database found
// -- white: server
// probe: updated usage info
// grep: fixed grep -a and grep -f losing the last result found
// perms: perms lock [opt] will now take a path in addition to the keywords: all, partial, down
// -- providing a path locks that path recursively
// --eg: perms lock /root
// perms: unlock now takes a path in addition to the keyword: all
// --eg: perms unlock /bin
// lock: the lock alias for perms lock all has been made into a command with additional options
// -- lock by itself will work as normal
// -- lock [path|file_object] will lock that path, recursively
// kore: updated usage info
// air: fixed pathing issue causing a crash on startup 
// air: menu has changed!!!! be sure to take note of the new menu options when cracking wifi
// air: will search the system for file.cap instead of assuming current path or home_dir
// -- current public version of the game has weird current_path vs launch_path rules
// -- experimental might fix this but for now we have to search for file.cap because it can end up in a number of folders depending on the situation
// -- using tree instead of grep so that the search is silent
// air: will now prompt for the final destination folder for the generated .cap file
// -- leave blank (press enter) to use default; currentPath
// zap: you may now pass an inject value to zap when preselecting an attack
// --eg: zap 1 password, zap 1 191.168.0.2
// zap: you may use the -r flag to skip the BUFFER prompt
// --eg: zap -r 1 password
// -- remember that zap [mem] [val] [opt:inject] will already skip all prompts
// run: you may now run binaries on a system without the 'run' prepend
// -- this is to give run more bash-like performance
// -- simply typing the full or relative path is sufficient to run an external script
// -- note that macros take priority over this;
// ---- a macro named the same as a file or command will be processed instead of the file or command
// -- using run to run scripts will still work, of course
// run: updated usage info and usage examples
// zap: updated usage info
// meta: will now return the linked/loaded metaLib for ease of piping
// macro: fixed typo causing crash when viewing usage info
// -- added info about escaping ez_clip (eg @a, @b) with '\'
// ----eg macro set foo " echo \@b " vs macro set foo " echo @b "
// macro: will now print the macro string to be executed
// macro: will now warn if a macro shares the name with an existing command
// -- if a command and a macro share the same name, the macro will execute, not the command
// macro: added warning if macro contains infinite loop // produces FALSE POSITIVES!!!! but otherwise doesn't interfere
// fetch: added -b -- fetch binaries; works same as the button in malp/rsi
// -- fetch -b [opt: path] [piped_shell] 
// -- defaults to current path
//
// if: fixed bug preventing if from working correctly
// -- also updated output
// -- it is now safe to do silly things like: if " echo bar " " echo foo " " if bar bar \" echo foo \" foo " bar
// enum: updated usage info
// kore: fixed typo in kore -S usage info 
// kore: added temporary hack to ensure kore clears all mail.txt and bank.txt
// -- grep -a is omitting it's last result from it's return, fix it
// rsi: added rsi -l -- return the length of the rshell buffer
// -- added rsi [-k|-K] -- remove rkit and scrub log on all rshelled machines
// -- added rsi --export -- return the rshell buffer as a list
// -- updated usage info
// --eg: macro set bubye " rsi -k || rsi -p y "
// macro: will now accept piped input
// macro: updated usage info
// -- when setting a macro the @pipe point in the string will be replaced by whatever was piped to the macro call
// macro: adjusted output of macro -l|list
// purge: fixed incorrect prompt for purge -m; it will no longer ask if you want to clear rshells when purging macros
// cob: added validate function to ensure the custom object contains the macros and stack_pool indexes
// --: 5hell will auto-call this routine in as many appropriate cases as I am able anticipate
// perms: added /bin/bash and /etc/init.d to the anti-brick routine for 'lock' (aka perms lock all)
// sc: added /bin/bash to nuke routine
// rclean: added /bin/bash to nuke routine
//
// air: will now search filesystem for .cap files instead of only current path
// pwgen: will now use HOME_SERVER[6] settings for default path for writing tables/tp and tables/t5
// -- this string must end in: /tables/t5
// ---- don't forget!
// --eg: if HOME_SERVER[6] is: /root/rkit/tables/t5
// ---- then pwgen will write tables/t5 and tables/tp to /root/rkit
// --NOTE: kore -r will still copy tables from anywhere on the filesystem into rkit when run
// ----- this will likely change in the future
// pwgen: fixed: the last password file being overwritten, resulting in lost passwords
// hashim: will now use HOME_SERVER settings for default paths to the pass/swap file and the tables folder
// -- will search fs for tables if not found in specified folder, as a backup
// rshell: will now use HOME_SERVER settings for default port, as well as default ip, of rshell server
// checkUser: updated to not reject ftpshells
// malp: fixed: scp gives a malformed error message on bad download
// malp: fixed ftpshell handler to actually handle ftpshells
// -- note: ftpshell.put is currently broken in the game
// -- you can still -upload- to an ftpshell from a regular shell with scp, though
// -- just no downloading from an ftpshell (no ftpshell.put)
// rsi: changed locals.shells to locals.rshells
// 5hell.src: you may now use || to seperate commands without piping output
// -- this works the same as piping to empty space, ie:
// ---- echo one | echo two |  | echo three
// -- is the same as
// ---- echo one | echo two || echo three
// -- where the last command will only echo 'three' and not the output of the previous commands
// -- this is '&&' in most shells, i think
// -- updated pipe usage info
// ezclip: fixed "to_int not found in map" when using @p
// perms: corrected note when using lock:
// -- the command to bypass anti-brick is: perms lock down
// -- not perms lock all
// -- the 'lock' alias is aliased to perms lock all
// games: drug wars: adjusted difficulty of officer hardass
// -- adjusted several values including inventory space, event frequency, drug size
//
// pwgen/cerebrum: the default dir for tables has been moved to home_dir/rkit/tables
// -- this way you can take it with you when uploading and use it if you, for instance, start_terminal and lose stuff in memory
// -- be sure to move your currently existing /root/tables to your rkit folder!
// -- kore -r will now copy tables to rkit, if it exists outside of rkit 
// cererum: please note that when cerebrum auto-imports the dictionary from tables, it uses a grep routine
// -- meaning you do not *have* to put tables in rkit
// ---- cerebrum will detect it anywhere on the system - at launch -
// -- using the @home function of cerebrum will use the information in HOME_SERVER 
// -- the @home function uses ssh for connection 
// -- ip, port, username, password, and path to tables are all utilized, please define these appropriately
//
// games: drug wars: updated wealth values for all neighborhoods (hopefully this makes winning more feasable)
// do: launching 5hell with do now accepts all params passed
// -- you may launch 5hell with params without the do # prepend
// -- launching with do as the first param will still exit when complete
// -- launching with do as the first param has two modes:
// -- if -f is not params[2] then everything from params[2] and on will be wrapped in floating quotes when processed
// ---- this means the whole line will be executed as a single do script
// ---- if  params[2] is -f then the file named in params[3] will be launched first, then the rest of the line will evaluate
// -- launching with commands without do as the first param will result in the whole line being evaluated
// ---- 5hell will not exit once the evaluation is complete
// do: added the above to usage info
// do: updated usage info to include info about adding comments to a do script
// 5hell.src: added 8th element to HOME_SERVER: int:default=1222 rshell server port
// rshell: will use HOME_SERVER[7] as default rshell server port
// help: actually added the line for help daemon to the help page, oops
//
// malp: hotfix: copy and move in the file handler will actually work now
// malp: file handler fixes:
// --: fixed crash in copy routine
// --: combined copy and move routine 
// --: fixed rename routine 
// --: removed duplicate curl routine
// --: added spam routine: fill a folder with a bunch of copies
// malp: shell handler will now loop until exited the same way the computer handler does
// credits: added: bakeneko, GSQ, blujoker for ideas and bug catching
//
// mail: added command line login
// -- mail [email] [opt:password]
// mail: added command line brutus login
// -- mail [email] -brutus
// mail: added command line spool option
// -- mail spool [opt:path]
// -- must be logged in to spool mail
// ez_clip: fixed a crashed when when using @B on a bad index; missing b_err
// 5hell.src: changed load order of prelaunch stuffs:
// -- stack_pool now loads before do.rc to prevent a negative stackpool when do.rc calls 'run'
// meta: load (and load_lib) will take a full_path as well as a filename
// -- previously it only loaded libs in /lib, now you can load any lib
// -- be aware you may only EXPLOIT libs in /lib
// -- but checking things like version and patched status they don't need to be
// meta: updated usage info for the above
// rclean: updated usage info regarding using a premade 'silentclean' scrub file
// -- poorly documented feature needed more attention
// -- will now copy the scrub file over the log instead of moving it
// silentclean: added the above to silentclean
// -- will now search for a file named 'silentclean' and use it if it finds it
// -- will move the scrub file over the log instead of copying it
//
// string: fixed crash in -N no_parse option: p_str -> sp_str
// chop: added 'split' search param to usage info so ppl looking for 'split' can find it
// -- why did a command that is all about split not have split in the usage info? fiik
// aptm: finished command line options for aptm
// aptm: will correctly check for updates and not update up-to-date libs
// -- remember that you can give aptm update a path to any file or directory
// -- passing a directory updates all libs in that directory
// kore: will run silentclean as part of [-s|-S] secure routine
// -- seriously, this whole time I thought it already was :/
// kore: will no longer run kore -s before kore -r
//
// 5hell.5pk: changed the load order of globals and 5phinx/contrib to accommodate the super_import change
// 5hell.5pk/5phinx.5pk: will now use globals.super_import (located in 5phinx.5pk) to import libs
// -- this replaces hot_swap_libs used by aptm
// -- this will ensure the latest lib version is loaded on startup
// -- this will load metaxploit, crypto, and aptclient from any directory with any filename
// -- the latest version will be used if multiples are detected
// -- this will also be implemented into: meta -i and meta restore
// -- the old globals.metaxploit, et al., will eventually be deprecated and replaced by the above
// aptm: changed error text
// help: added help daemon
// -- updated help alias and help convention
// ---- added information about escaping quotes and @-aliases
// if: returns reference when result is a raw (non command) function
// chop: fixed missing char(10) that was preventing full usage info from printing
// scpm: removed blod tag from local ip in trajectory prompt to make it a little easier to read
// -- hopefully :\
// kore: added -S for a more paranoid secure routine
// kore: fixed weird bug that was causing kore -s to run twice in some cases
// 
// ez_clip: all ez clips can be escaped with \
// --eg: \@a , \" , \@o, \@home, etc... 
// -- this will help with using variables in macros
// -- allowing them to be set when the macro is run, not when it's made
// purge: changed over two legacy "purge -d" internal calls to "purge -x"
//
// htop: reformatted usage info
// outmon: reformatted usage info
// hashim: reformatted usage info
// macro: removed bold tag from output
// purge: -o option will no longer remove the stack_pool 
//
// purge: -o option will no longer remove the macros registry
// purge: added -m; clear macros
// purge: changed -m; clear daemons to -d; clear daemons
// purge: changed -d; purge xploits to -x; purge xploits
// purge: updated usage info
// ez_clip: added @t for target ip and @p for target port
// eg: meta link @t @p
//
// exit: removed msg check as it was a bad idea
// removed the import line for games.5pk
//
// games.5pk: is no more, it has been changed to contrib.5pk
// contrib.5pk: will contain functions and commands contributed by the community
// -- this is mainly because the other .5pks were running out of room and games.5pk had plenty of space
// --note: glosure, the daemon manager, the regex engine, htop, and check user have been moved to contrib.5pk 
// -- the three games are still in contrib.5pk
// -- the import code line has been moved to just under the import 5phinx line in 5hell.5pk
// -- formerly this line was located within the command.games function
// This marks the beginning of the great 5hell refactoring where code will be consolidated, objectified and organized
//
// macro: moved all macros to the macro registry
// --: this is a map within the custom object
// macro: added macro [-l|list]
// --: this will return a string with all macros and their definitions
// --: cob get macros (or just 'get macros') will return the macros map
// macro: added macro [-g|get] [name] to return a given macro's string
// macro: fixed hard crash in usage info
//
// do.rc: removed wildly counter-productive line from _resource_configuration
// rclean: hopefully won't shit itself anymore when using -n
// macro: added macro registry
// macro: corrected usage info
// --: creating a macro requires -s|set flag: macro [-s|set] [name] [value]
// cob: will no longer spam usage info on bad input
//
// 5hell.src: added more info to display when typing 'shell'
// db: added a warning about mismatched files when loading a local lib with a remote metaxploit object
// -- this is until i can figure out a smarter way to handle that case
// 5phinx.5pk: added _cascade function which will cascade exit if start_terminal is called
// -- this is to solve the need to manually exit 5hell if using psudo in a nested launch
// removed NIGHTLY global references
// removed more commented code
// adjusted usage info of diff and zc
// usr: added missing -a/-d flags for add and delete
//
// silentclean: will no longer spam usage info on bad input
// --: remember that now you can: gp -d " sc | return " @B [index]
// --: or lazy bones it with: gp -d sc -m
// --: will print a warning and continue to scrub locally
// glasspool: corrected typoe in help info: glaspool -> glasspool
// glasspool: added ability to specify a command or macro when initializing glasspool
// --eg: glasspool -d " echo bob " @B [index]
// code: fixed hard crash when passing invalid (or no) input to functions in the generic object handler
// -- will now warn the user if a function is required; ie no default
// -- the function will now return if the argument is required 
// -- arguments with defaults are parsed as the default if no input
// -- ints wrapped in ' will be cast as strings; eg '1' == string, 1 == number
// -- you may now type null to specify the null character in this context
//
// added daemon control!!
// -- hashim, rsi, and outmon will now make use of a daemon control system
// -- when running in daemon mode a file named 5hell.d will be created in /root
// -- individual lines in this file can be removed to end a daemon without using ctrl+c
// -- cool stuff! thanks redit0!
//
// updated credits
// added greybel support
//
// glosure: bug fix
// tree: removed unused code
// grep: added -a option to return all matched files as a list
// kore: fixed infinite loop when kore doesn't have write permissions to Mail.txt/Bank.txt 
//
// 5hell.5pk: removed unused code
// dtools.5pk: removed unused code
// dtools.5pk & kore.5pk: moved hashim and tdump from kore to dtools
// kore.5pk: removed unused code
// kore.5pk: added glosure as a new command
// -- thanks rocketorbit!
// -- be sure to check the usage info and follow the link found there for more info
// credits: added credit to rocketorbit for glosure code
// credits: added inspiration/idea credit to: Conner, STYX, Fear_Rua, Penelope
// cob: reenabled @clipa/b/c replacement inputs
//
// 5hell.src: moved HOME_SERVER configuration to BEFORE the 5hell.5pk import line
// -- be sure to update this to avoid an undefined identifier error
// macro: now requires a [-s|set] flag in order to create a macro
// -- this is to avoid overwriting a macro on accident with piped input when calling a macro
// brutus: reverted disabling in glasspool; now it just warns
// hashim: added TABLES_DIR global that hashim will use to find the hash tables
// -- default is still /root/tables/t5
// -- edit this in the globals.HOME_SERVER variable in 5hell.src, NOT the TABLES_DIR var in 5hell.5pk
//
// brutus: disabled while GLASSPOOL is active; brutus doesn't translate through glasspool it just ends up rooting your own machine; so now it wont
// kore: -r will now create an empty database.csv if it doesn't exist
// kore: -r will now highlight the path used to cp 5hell into rkit (as well as properly rename it to 5hell)
// --NOTE: kore -r copies 5hell from the launch path of the instance of 5hell running the command
// ----: mind your launch path to ensure the correct 5hell is copied
// dig: will create an empty database.csv if it doesn't exist
// dig: dig.bat is created on dig's first run or when you use: dig --edit (or manually create it, of course)
// -- the default dig.bat is bare bones, please customize it to suit the behavior you desire
// silentclean: nuke option (sc -n) will now require the override flag '--n' before executing on a machine running Xorg (aka a home pc)
// -- this is to help protect you from nuking yourself on accident but still allow you to nuke yourself on purpose
// rclean: -n will now properly nuke the filesystem
// -- note, since rclean requires you to specify a shell/computer/file object, it does NOT have the same restriction as the above
// -- please nuke responsibly
// db: passing -i to a db -r call should now result in a prompt for an inject
// db: will no longer use a default inject of 'password'
// -- this is to avoid unintentional password changes
// string: -r (replace): will use @[int] in order to specify a specific character code
// --eg: string -r bob @32 " this is a string withbobin it " -- would replace 'bob' with a space
// -- use @0 for a 'zero space' character; aka: ""
//
// changed malp and memory alpha to auto-open a piped value
// moved rnip and porter to kore.5pk because 5hell.5pk ran out of room
// macro: you may now run macro's WITHOUT the 'macro' prepend!!!!!!!!!
// --i.e.: set a macro with: macro " [string of commands or whatever] "
// -- then fire the macro with: |> [macro_name]
// -- combining this with `do.rc` lets you set macro's at runtime
// -- aka: easy way to add new commands!!
// -- this change is a single line in 5hell.src, first entry for aliases
// ---- at the time of this post, it's line 191 (may change in the future, of course)
// ---- in case you want to easily add it to your custom 5hell.src
// psudo: complete overhaul of function and usage info
// -- hopefully how it works (and why to use it) is much clearer now
// zap: will no longer offer to start terminal on a shell
// -- instead it will buffer it as normal then offer to open that object in the BUFFER 
// -- please note that executing zap without the menu does NOT result in a prompt
// -- i.e.: zap [mem] [add] [inj] == no prompt || zap == prompt
// -- both options will still return the shell object as normal
// -- the default choice for opening the shell in the buffer is Y
// -- if y'all would prefer N be the default, let me know and we'll switch it
//
// do: fixed typo causing crash when using do -h
// cname: fixed typo in usage info
// calc: will no longer spam usage info on bad input
//
// meta: fixed several places that the update from meta link -r|-l changing to meta load|link was missing

// kraken: hotfix to fix completely busted status
//
// if: fixed commands not evaluating correctly
// -- ezclip evaluates before the if statement, this can cause problems
